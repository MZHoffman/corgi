# `usePreventScroll`

The `usePreventScroll` hook allows you to toggle the document's `<body>` element scrollability. This is useful for cases when dialog/modal windows are displayed. This hook is available by default, from within the [@wethegit/react-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wethegit/react-hooks) NPM package. Have a look at the docs there for more information.
