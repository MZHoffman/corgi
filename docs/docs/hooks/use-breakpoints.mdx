```
1: small

4: x-large
5: xx-large
```

import useBreakpoints from "#hooks/use-breakpoints";

import MyMobileDeviceComponent from "../somewhere"

const MyComponent = () => {
  const breakpoint = useBreakpoints()

  return breakpoint < 3 ? (
    <MyMobileDeviceComponent />
  ) : (
    <WildlyDifferentDesktopComponent />
  )
