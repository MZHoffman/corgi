# `useUserPrefs`

The `useUserPrefs` hook gives us access to various user preferences, the values of which are stored in localStorage. This hook is available by default, from within the [@wethegit/react-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wethegit/react-hooks) NPM package.

`useUserPrefs()`

## Return value

`useUserPrefs` returns an object containing the following properties:

| Property                      | Type     | Description |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| prefersDarkColorScheme        | Boolean  | Whether the user has either turned on "prefers dark color scheme" in their OS-level settings, or has chosen the option exposed by your site via some UI. |
| togglePrefersDarkColorScheme  | Function | Accepts a sole property (Boolean) which toggles the local/site state of `prefersDarkColorScheme`. |
| prefersReducedData            | Boolean  | Whether the user has either turned on "prefers reduced data" in their OS-level settings, or has chosen the option exposed by your site via some UI. |
| togglePrefersReducedData      | Function | Accepts a sole property (Boolean) which toggles the local/site state of `prefersReducedData`. |
| prefersReducedMotion          | Boolean  | Whether the user has either turned on "prefers reduced motion" in their OS-level settings, or has chosen the option exposed by your site via some UI. |
| togglePrefersReducedMotion    | Function | Accepts a sole property (Boolean) which toggles the local/site state of `prefersReducedMotion`. |

## Usage

Here we're passing a dynamic animation duration prop to an imaginary `<Menu>` component. The duration will change based on the state of `prefersReducedMotion`.

```jsx
import { useUserPrefs } from "@wethegit/react-hooks";
import Menu from "../somewhere"

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { prefersReducedMotion } = useUserPrefs();

  <Menu animationDuration={prefersReducedMotion ? 1200 : 0} />
};
```
