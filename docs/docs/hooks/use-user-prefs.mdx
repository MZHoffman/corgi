# `useUserPrefs`

The `useUserPrefs` hook gives us access to various user preferences — such as `prefers-reduced-motion`, `prefers-reduced-color-scheme`, and more — the values of which are stored in localStorage. This hook is available by default, from within the [@wethegit/react-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wethegit/react-hooks) NPM package. Have a look at the docs there for more information.
