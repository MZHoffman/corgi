# `useAsync`

The `useAsync` hook manages the calling of an asynchronous JavaScript function, while also providing you with the return data and the state of the function call. This hook is available by default, from within the [@wethegit/react-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wethegit/react-hooks) NPM package. Have a look at the docs there for more information.
