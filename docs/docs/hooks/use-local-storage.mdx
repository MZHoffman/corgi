# `useLocalStorage`

Location: `/src/hooks/use-local-storage.js`

The `useLocalStorage` is a state manager, similar to React's `useState`,  but all values are set and retrieved based on the user's browser localStorage.

`useLocalStorage(key, [defaultValue])`

| Arguments    | Type   | Description |
| ------------ | ------ | ----------- |
| key          | String | The localStorage key to get and set. |
| defaultValue | String | Optional. The default value for `key`. Default: `""`. |

## Return value

Similar to React's `useState` hook, `useLocalStorage` returns an array containing the state value and a state updater function:

| Array index | Type     | Description |
| ----------- | -------- | ----------- |
| 0           | String   | The browser's localStorage value corresponding to the `key` argument passed. |
| 1           | Function | Updater function which expects the new state value as the sole argument. |

## Usage

Here's an admittedly-contrived example, which sets the localStorage value of `userID` to `"1234"`, and logs out the value from localStorage to verify that it's working.

```jsx
import useLocalStorage from "../../hooks/use-local-storage";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [id, setId] = useLocalStorage("userID")

  const handleClick = (_) => setId("1234")
  
  console.log(window.localStorage.getItem("userID"))

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Set user ID to "1234"</button>
  )
};
```
