# `useLocalStorage`

The `useLocalStorage` is a state manager, similar to React's `useState`,  but all values are set and retrieved based on the user's browser localStorage. This hook is available by default, from within the [@wethegit/react-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wethegit/react-hooks) NPM package. Have a look at the docs there for more information.
