# Add pages

Pages live within the `src/pages/[locale]` directory. `[locale]` is a [dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes), which gets swapped out with the appropriate locale string in the URL ("en-US", "fr-CA", "pt-BR", etc.)

By default, an index page ("home page") and a sub-page will be created for you within the project. The home page, specifically, behaves slightly differently than sub-pages, so we'll outline each below.

## Home page

Your homepage layout lives in `src/components/home-page-contents`. Any content on the homepage must be built within this component.

## Sub-pages

All sub-pages live within the `src/pages/[locale]/sub-page-name` directory, and expect an index.js file as their source.

## Creating new pages

The easiest way to create new pages is by using the **Corgi CLI**:

```sh
npx corgi page MySubPage
```

This will scaffold all the necessary files for authoring a new page: the page component itself, an SCSS module file, and all the appropriate locale data files.
