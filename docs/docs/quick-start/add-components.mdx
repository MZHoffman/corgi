# Components

Components typically live in the `src/components` directory. This is not a requirement, but it is recommended for consistency's sake, as the Corgi CLI creates components here.

## Creating a component

The easiest way to create new components is by using the [**Corgi CLI**](../category/corgi-cli):

```sh
npx corgi component MyButton
```

This will scaffold the component file itself, along with an SCSS module file.
