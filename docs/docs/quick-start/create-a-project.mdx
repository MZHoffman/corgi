# Create a project

The easiest way to set up a new project is via the **Corgi CLI**. This page walks through that process.

To create a new project, run the folling in the command line:

```sh
npx corgi project my-web-app
```

When prompted to enter a template URL, just press enter to skip the step for now. Feel free to jump ahead to read about **Corgi templates** though.

Once complete, navigate to your new project directory and install all dependencies:

```sh
cd my-web-app
```

```sh
npm install
```

ðŸŽ‰ **That's it! You're ready to start building your web app.**

:::info Directory prompt
If you prefer, you can omit the directory name argument when spinning up a project. The CLI will then prompt prompt you to enter a directory name upon running the command:

```sh
npx corgi project
```

:::caution Node.JS & NVM
Corgi requires **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 16 or greater**. If you use `nvm`, run the following before installing dependencies:

```sh
nvm use
```
