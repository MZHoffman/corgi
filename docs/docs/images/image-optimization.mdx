# Image optimization

corgi can optimize and compresses images for you; allowing you to only have to worry about uploading a single, high-res ("2x" pixel density) image. This optimization process generates compressed versions of these `2x` images, their `1x` counterparts, and `.webp` versions if applicable.

## Image source file location

To take advantage of corgi's image optimization, save your image _source_ files in the `/src/images/defined/` directory. You're welcome to make subdirectories within `defined/`. The images you add here must have the `-2x` suffix on their filenames. For example, `/src/images/defined/banner-logo-2x.png`. Note that the `-2x` suffix implies that the image is twice the size of its intended CSS dimensions. Don't worry about adding the single-pixel-density images ("1x"), as they will be automatically generated for use with devices/browsers that request them. If files are removed from this directory, corgi will pick up on that, and update the generated output accordingly.

## Image optimization output location

Once the source images are in place, running any of the following Node scripts (per the `package.json` scripts) will optimize your source images. The **output** files will be saved to `/public/_images/`. This directory is reserved for images optimized by corgi, so do not edit any of this directory's contents directly. Any changes to your images should _always_ be made from the source directory: `/src/images/defined/`.

```bash
# When developing, all images in the `src/images/defined/` directory will be watched for changes,
# and generated and optimized on-the-fly:
npm start

# When building for production, files will be generated and optimized based on the existing cache:
npm run build

# Manually run the file generation and optimization, based on the existing cache file:
npm run mash-build

# Manually run the file generation and optimization, creating a new cache file:
npm run mash-build-all
```

Here's an example source file tree, and the output file tree below it:

```txt title="Source image location"
.
└── src/
    └── images/
        └── defined/
            ├── banner-2x.jpg
            └── logo-2x.png
```

```txt title="Output image location"
.
└── public/
    └── _images/
        ├── banner-2x.jpg
        ├── banner.jpg
        ├── logo-2x.png
        ├── logo.png
        ├── logo-2x.webp
        └── logo.webp
```

As you can see in the example output above, not only are the 1x versions of the source files generated, but any `.png` images get `.webp` versions by default. And of course, all output files are compressed.

## Image formats

corgi's image compression is intended for `.jpg` and `.png` files.

If you need static `.svg`, `.mp4`, or assets of other formats, add them to the default Next.js `/public/` directory. Just remember not to tamper with the generated `/public/_images/` directory within. More on this in the [other static assets](./static-assets) section.

## Image usage

corgi provides a component for using the generated and optimized images. Check out the [`<Picture>` component docs](./picture-component) for more information.
