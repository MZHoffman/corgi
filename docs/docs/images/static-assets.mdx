# Other static assets

If your assets do not call for any [image optimization](./image-optimization) or breakpoint-specific versions (i.e. the [`<Picture>` component](./picture-component)), then they fall into this category.

You can include any assets in the `/public/` directory, to be served as static files from the compiled project's root. Do not tamper with the corgi-generated `/public/_images/` directory though, as that is reserved for images generated and optimized by corgi.

Formats like `.svg`, `.mp4`, `.mp3` (and so on) are good candidates for the `/public/` directory. There is no need to use any specific component to access these filesâ€”just use the HTML-native `<img>`, `<video>`, or `<audio>` elements, respectively.

:::info non-optimized images
You don't _have_ to buy-in to corgi's image system if you prefer not to. Any file format be accessed from the public folder just as you'd expect, by referencing the file path from the project's root `/`. For example, an image in `/public/images/logos/my-logo.png` would be accessed via `<img src="/images/logos/my-logo.png" alt="" />`.

## Examples

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <img src="/images/logo.png" alt="Description of company logo." />

      <img src="/images/diamond-icon.svg" alt="Diamond" />

      <audio src="/audio/annoying-background-music.mp3" muted controls />

      <video
        src="/videos/header-background.mp4"
        autoplay
        playsinline
        muted
        loop
        controls
      />
    </>
  );
};
```
