# Global Styles
	
By default, Corgi contains an array of unopinionated global styles. These are seperated into **four direcories** consisting of generic resets, site-wide CSS variables and useful helper/utility functions. The styles within Corgi provide each project with a foundation to build upon, these are intended to be edited and manipulated to fit your project.

## Base

`src/styles/base/`

The **base** directory is reserved for resets and generic styling, such as typography and spacing. Out of the box, `base` contains; `typography.scss`, `layout.scss` and `resets.scss`.

## Helpers

`src/styles/helpers/`

The **helpers** directory contains a selection of globally available SASS functions and mixins. Their uses are documented inline, within each file.

## Utility classes

`src/styles/utility-classes/`

The **utility-classes** directory houses a wide array of useful classes. These range from classes used for adding spacing, to showing/hiding content at certain breakpoints.

## Settings

`src/styles/settings/`

Lastly, the **settings** directory. This is home to all global settings, such as colors, breakpoints, animations durations etc. Settings are fully intended to be changed on a per project basis.
