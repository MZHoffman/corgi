# Global Styles

By default, Corgi contains a collection of global styles, which are seperated into **four direcories**. These consist of generic resets, CSS custom properties, SASS helper functions, and CSS utility classes. These pre-defined global styles provide you with a foundation to build upon, and many of them are intended to be edited to fit your project's needs.

All globals styles are imported at the App level, within `/src/pages/_app.js`. Each category of global settings are explained in more detail below.

## Base

`/src/styles/base/`

The **base** directory is reserved for resets and generic styling, such as typography and spacing. Out-of-the-box, `base` contains; `typography.scss`, `layout.scss` and `resets.scss`.

## Helpers

`/src/styles/helpers/`

The **helpers** directory contains a selection of globally available SASS functions and mixins. Their uses are documented inline, within each file.

## Utility classes

`/src/styles/utility-classes/`

The **utility-classes** directory houses a variety of useful CSS class names. These range from classes used for adding spacing, to showing/hiding content at certain breakpoints.

## Settings

`/src/styles/settings/`

Lastly, the **settings** directory. This is home to all global settings, such as colors, breakpoints, animations, column/gutter sizes, etc. Many of these settings are intended to be changed on a per project basis.
