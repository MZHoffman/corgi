# Flex-grid system

The flexbox-based grid layout system in corgi is based on the concept of rows and columns. A row acts as a flex container, while a column is a flex child. By default, the **flex** styles are not applied until the `medium-up` breakpoint (see [responsive-breakpoints](./responsive-breakpoints.mdx)). Despite this, other `.row` and `.column` style delarations _do_ apply (such as padding, for example).

This flex layout system also provides CSS modifier classes which allow the configuration of elements to different column sizes at different responsive breakpoints.

## Configuration

Out of the box, corgi provides a responsive flex-grid system with a max-width of 1440px wide, and contains 12 columns with a 24px gutter between each.

The grid can be configured in `/src/styles/settings/_settings-layout.scss`. If you are using Sketch, layout settings in Sketch should be configured to match with the flex layout configuration. The layout settings can be found under `View > Canvas > Layout Settings`.

The following options are available:

| SCSS variable           | Default value | Description                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $total-width            | 1392px        | This is the maximum width of a `.row` grid system, less the left and right gutters. |
| $number-of-columns      | 12            | The number of columns to include.                                                   |
| $gutter-width           | 16px          | The width of the gutters at the `small` breakpoint, in pixels.                      |
| $gutter-width-medium-up | 24px          | The width of the gutters, at the `medium-up` breakpoint, in pixels.                 |

## Basic usage

The simplest way to use the grid in practice is to create a row and, within that row, create some columns:

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="column column--4">
    <p>I'm a 4 column element</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column column--4">
    <p>I'm another 4 column element</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column column--4">
    <p>I'm a third 4 column element, together we add up to 12 columns</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Breakpoints

For layouts whose column spans change on a per-breakpoint basis, you can use breakpoint-specific classs. For more information on responsive breakpoints in corgi, see the [responsive breakpoints](./responsive-breakpoints.mdx) docs.

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="column column--10 column-xlarge--6">
    <p>I'm 10 columns at medium and large and 6 columns from xlarge and up</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column column--2 column-xlarge--6">
    <p>I'm 2 columns at medium and large and 6 columns from xlarge and up</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

This example will provide a grid row that contains 2 columns. At medium and large the first element will be 10 columns wide and the second 2, while at xlarge+ they will both be 6 columns wide.

:::info Mobile-first
These breakpoints employ a mobile-first philosophy â€” that is, standard "column--X" classes will work for all breakpoints from `medium` and above; "column-large--X" classes will work for all breakpoints from `large` and above; "column-xlarge--X" classes will work for all breakpoints from `xlarge` and above; and so on.

## Nested columns

It's also possible to nest rows and columns. This is particularly useful when you want to create another "instance" of a flex-grid layout _inside_ an existing `.column` element that spans, say, 10 columns.

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="column column--10">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="column column--deep column--6">
        <p>I'm a nested element that spans 6 columns of my parent row.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column column--deep column--6">
        <p>I'm a nested element that spans 6 columns of my parent row.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="column column--2">
      <p>I'm an element that spans 2 columns</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

This code creates a 10-column element that contains two 6-column elements. Note that the width of a column within a _nested_ row will be relative to that columns's closest parent `.row` (because they're percentage-based widths).

Note the `"column--deep"` className on nested columns here. This removes default left and right padding which is necessary for non-nested columns. Nested rows behave similarly, but do not need an explicit className.

## Available classNames

| className                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| wrapper                        | Apply this to a container element when you want the maximum width and padding of a `.row`, but do _not_ want a flex layout.                                                                                                 |
| row                            | Allows an element to behave as a container in the flex layout system. Adds a max-width based on your [config](#configuration), among other things. By default, elements within the row will be center-aligned horizontally. |
| row--nowrap                    | Modifier. Ensures that immediate child elements do not wrap when they move beyond the maximum column count for a row.                                                                                                       |
| row--vertical-center           | Modifier. Vertically centers immediate child elements of a `.row`.                                                                                                                                                          |
| row--horizontal-uncenter       | Modifier. Left-aligns immediate child elements of a `.row`.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| column                         | Base className for flex children of a `.row`.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| column--&lt;number&gt;         | Modifier. Creates an element that spans `<number>` of columns. `<number>` must be a whole-number, and between `1` and `$number-of-columns`. Example: `column--10`.                                                          |
| column-large--&lt;number&gt;   | Modifier. Applies a specific column span to the `large-up` media query.                                                                                                                                                     |
| column-xlarge--&lt;number&gt;  | Modifier. Applies a specific column span to the `xlarge-up` media query.                                                                                                                                                    |
| column-xxlarge--&lt;number&gt; | Modifier. Applies a specific column span to the `xxlarge-up` media query.                                                                                                                                                   |
| column--deep                   | Modifier. Removes gutters (left and right padding) from the `.column`. Used when nesting layout systems.                                                                                                                    |

## SCSS Helpers

In addition to providing classNames, the flex-grid system also provides some SCSS helper functions that are useful when you want to extend the layout system or create utility classNames of your own.

### grid-calc

Function. Returns a percentage that conforms to the number of columns provided. This is useful when trying to offset columns by a specific number of columns (via left or right margin, for example). The following example will add two columns worth of left margin.

```scss title="grid-calc example"
@use "../../styles/helpers/helpers-layout" as *;

.my-element {
  margin-left: grid-calc(2);
}
```
