    "description": "Corgi does come with a set of opinionated, pre-defined styles — including utility classes, flex-based grid system, typography settings, and more. Despite this, you are free to style your Corgi project using your preferred method. Corgi is just an extension of Next.JS v12, so if it works there, it'll work here. Corgi comes pre-installed with SASS (as `.scss`), as its styling framework is written in SASS."
