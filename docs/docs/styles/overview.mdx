# Overview

Corgi uses SASS `.scss` by default, but also handles vanilla CSS `.css` out the box.

All componenet level styles use [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). As these styles are scoped to components, there is no need to follow any strict CSS methodologies/naming conventions (BEM/OOCSS).

# Global styles

Global styles live in `globals.scss`, which are imported into `_app.js`. These are inherited by evey page throughout the project. By default this file consists of:

- Mixins/helpers
- Global settings and variables
- Global styles
- Global utilities

Each of these will be broken down separately in the next section.

```
/* src/styles/globals.scss */

// Mixins/helpers specific to this file:
@use "./helpers/helpers-a11y" as *;

// Global settings and variables
@import "./settings/settings-animation";
@import "./settings/settings-breakpoints";
@import "./settings/settings-color";
@import "./settings/settings-layout";
@import "./settings/settings-reduced-motion";

// Global style declarations:
@import "./base/resets.scss";
@import "./base/layout.scss";
@import "./base/typography.scss";

// Global utility classes:
@import "./utility-classes/utils-a11y.scss";
@import "./utility-classes/utils-breakpoints.scss";
@import "./utility-classes/utils-color.scss";
@import "./utility-classes/utils-image.scss";
@import "./utility-classes/utils-in-view.scss";
@import "./utility-classes/utils-layout.scss";
@import "./utility-classes/utils-typography.scss";

*:focus {
  @include focus-style;

  outline: none;

  &:not(:focus-visible) {
    box-shadow: none;
  }
}
```

```
/* src/pages/_app.js */

import "../styles/globals.scss";
