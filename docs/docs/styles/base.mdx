# Base styles

The base level styles consist of three files; `resets.scss`, `layout.scss` and `typography.scss`. The contents of these files are a mixture of CSS variables and general resets that are imported into `global.scss`. These all live in the `base` directory, as show below: 

```
src/styles/base/
```

## Resets

`resets.scss` is a striped back version of the [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/8.0.1/normalize.css) package.

## Layout

`layout.scss` consists of the global variables used for spacing throughout the project as well as the default Corgi grid system. These will be explained further in the `settings` section, which is their values are set.

## Typography

`typography.scss` is where the default font styles (family, size, weight) are set.
