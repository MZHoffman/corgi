# Locale settings

Project-level locale configuration lives in the `src/config-locales.js` file. It is here that you can define your default locale, all of your supported locales, and various other locale-specific information you might need.

By default, Corgi sets you up with `"en"` as your default locale, and `"en"`, `"es"`, and `"fr"` as your supported locales.

Edit this data per your project's needs. Ensure that the strings entered correspond with what you want your URLs to look like.

The following sections outline the most commonly-edited settings in the locale config.

## defaultLocale

The default locale string for your project.

```js src/config-locales.js
module.exports = {
  defaultLocale: "en",

  // other properties omitted for brevity
};
```

## locales

The supported locale strings for your project.

```js src/config-locales.js
module.exports = {
  locales: ["en", "es", "fr"],

  // other properties omitted for brevity
};
```

## localeMap

A map of locale strings to various bits of relevant data you might need. For example, if your locale is `"en"`, but you want your HTML's `lang` attribute to be `"en-US"`, you could put that data here. All of this information is available via the [`useLocale`](./use-locale-hook) hook.

```js src/config-locales.js
module.exports = {
  localeMap: new Map([
    [
      "en",
      {
        language: "en-US",
        someAPIEndpointLocale: "en_US",
      },
    ],
    [
      "es",
      {
        language: "es-ES",
        someAPIEndpointLocale: "es_ES",
      },
    ],
    [
      "fr",
      {
        language: "fr-FR",
        someAPIEndpointLocale: "fr_FR",
      },
    ],
  ]),

  // other properties omitted for brevity
};
```
