# Locale settings

Project-level locale configuration lives in the `src/config-locales.js` file. It is here that you can define your default locale, all of your supported locales, and various other locale-specific information you might need. While this config will be used for general localization setup, it will also be conveniently exposed to your components and pages via the [`useLocale`](./use-locale-hook) React hook.

By default, Corgi sets you up with `"en"` as your default locale, and `"en"`, `"es"`, and `"fr"` as your supported locales.

Edit this data per your project's needs. Ensure that the strings entered correspond with what you want your URLs to look like.

The following sections outline the most commonly-edited settings in the locale config.

## defaultLocale

The default locale string for your project. Your default locale's homepage will live at the root of the site `/`, while its subpages will live at `/<default locale>/<subpage-name>`

```js src/config-locales.js
module.exports = {
  defaultLocale: "en",

  // other properties omitted for brevity
};
```

## locales

The supported locale strings for your project. _All_ pages of the project in these locales (with the exception of the [defaultLocale](#defaultLocale), see above) will live at `/<locale string>/<page name>`.

```js src/config-locales.js
module.exports = {
  locales: ["en", "es", "fr"],

  // other properties omitted for brevity
};
```

## localeMap

A map of locale strings to various bits of relevant data you might need. For example, if your locale is `"en"`, but you want your HTML's `lang` attribute to be `"en-US"`, you could put that data here. All of this information is available via the [`useLocale`](./use-locale-hook) hook.

```js src/config-locales.js
module.exports = {
  localeMap: new Map([
    [
      "en",
      {
        language: "en-US",
        someAPIEndpointLocale: "en_US",
      },
    ],
    [
      "es",
      {
        language: "es-ES",
        someAPIEndpointLocale: "es_ES",
      },
    ],
    [
      "fr",
      {
        language: "fr-FR",
        someAPIEndpointLocale: "fr_FR",
      },
    ],
  ]),

  // other properties omitted for brevity
};
```
