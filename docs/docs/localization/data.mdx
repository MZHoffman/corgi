# Locale data

Static site data for each locale is grouped into two general categories: the "global" data and the "page" data. Global data refers to site-wide content—things like navigation menus, footers, and so on—while page data refers to page-specific content—things like a homepage header, or a biography for an "about" page.

All static locale data lives within the `src/locales/` directory, and is grouped into these two categories. You can treat the `globals` directory as a reserved directory name, as all global (site-wide) data is compiled from within it. All other directories here, however, are page-level data directories which should match each page's filename as it exists in the `src/pages/` directory.

Within both `src/locales/globals/` and `src/locales/<page-name>/`, should live YAML files containing the actual locale data. Each YAML file's name should be the locale string as specified in the [locale config](./configuration#locales), with a `.yml` extension.

Here is an example file tree, containing global data as well as data for two pages—all containing content for three locales:

```
.
└── src/
    └── locales/
        ├── globals/
        │   ├── en.yml
        │   ├── es.yml
        │   └── fr.yml
        ├── home/
        │   ├── en.yml
        │   ├── es.yml
        │   └── fr.yml
        └── about/
            ├── en.yml
            ├── es.yml
            └── fr.yml
```

## Locale data compilation

Under the hood, all of these files get compiled into two objects—`globals` and `page`—and are then passed to each page as props. This process is done via Next JS' `getStaticProps` convention. The [`useLocale`](./use-locale-hook) hook is a convenient way to work with this data from _any_ functional React component in your project.

## `globals` example

An example `globals` YAML file for the `"en"` locale:

```yml title="/src/locales/globals/en.yml"
meta:
  title: My Cool Web App
  description: The site-wide meta description.
  og_alt: Description of the og image.

nav:
  label: Main site navigation
  items:
    - id: home
      label: Home
    - id: about
      label: About Us
    - id: contact
      label: Get in touch

footer: © Company Name.
```

As mentioned, that data gets compiled into a page-level prop called `globals`, for the current page and locale. Here's an example that uses that data (via [`useLocale`](./use-locale-hook)) from within an imaginary `<Navigation />` component:

```jsx
import useLocale from "../../hooks/use-locale"

const Navigation = () => {
  const { globals } = useLocale()

  return (
    <nav aria-labelledby="nav-label">
      <span id="nav-label" className="visually-hidden">{globals.nav.label}</span>
      <ul>
        {globals.nav.items.map(item => (
          <li key={item.id}>{item.label}</li>
        )}
      </ul>
    </nav>
  )
}

export default Navigation
```

## `page` example

An example `about` page YAML file for the `"en"` locale:

```yml title="/src/locales/about/en.yml"
meta:
  title: About Us
  description: Our team is pretty cool. We do cool things.

title: About Us

bio: Aliqua irure sint ea amet duis exercitation labore non occaecat velit voluptate. Ipsum fugiat officia irure consequat laborum in incididunt sit magna ex deserunt reprehenderit veniam ea.
```

This data gets compiled into a page-level prop called `page`, for the current page and locale. Here's an example that uses that data (via [`useLocale`](./use-locale-hook)) from within an imaginary About page component:

```jsx
import useLocale from "../../hooks/use-locale"

const AboutPage = () => {
  const { page } = useLocale()

  return (
    <header aria-labelledby="about-title">
      <h1 id="about-title">{page.title}</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p>{page.bio}</p>
    </main>
  )
}

export default AboutPage
```
