# Installation

You can install the `corgi` command globally, via:

```bash
npm install -g @corgi/cli
```

Alternatively, you can use `npx`, which pulls and installs the executable _locally_, on demand:

```
npx @corgi/cli component ToggleButton
```

Read on to learn about the specific `corgi` commands for creating new projects, pages, and components.
