# What is corgi?

corgi is a toolkit for creating localized, static React web applications with Next.js. It was born out of a specific need to localize _statically-exported_ Next.js projects.

The corgi toolkit consists of:

- A framework for creating localized, statically-generated (SSG) projects using Next.js.
- A command line interface (CLI) for easily creating new projects, pages, and components.

## External resources

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API. corgi is built on Next JS 12.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

To learn more about React, check out the [React documentation (beta)](https://beta.reactjs.org/).

You can treat most of this project as you would any other Next.js SSG app (static site generation), so the documentation above will be invaluable. This is a custom framework however, as Next's SSG does not work with any existing localization packages in the community. Thus, the corgi documentation will help you get up and running with lozalization and SSG!
