# corgi

corgi is a framework and toolkit for creating statically-generated, localized web apps via Next JS. Unfortunately, you cannot pet the corgi.

- Easy localization within _static_ Next.js projects.
- Full SCSS framework for layout, typography, and more.
- Command line interface for quickly and easily setting up projects, pages, and components.

Check out the [corgi documentation](https://wethegit.github.io/corgi) for an in-depth guide to its usage.
